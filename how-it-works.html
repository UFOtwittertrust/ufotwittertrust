                        <h3>Core Concept</h3>
                        <p>
                            The Twitter Trust System is an experimental reputation system based on the concept of 
                            eigenvector-based trust metrics, similar to Google's PageRank algorithm but with human-directed 
                            trust assignments.
                        </p>
                        
                        <h3>Key Features</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Simple Rating System:</strong> Rate any Twitter user from 0 (complete distrust) 
                                to 100 (complete trust), with 50 being neutral.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Normalized Trust Assignments:</strong> Your ratings are automatically normalized using L2 normalization 
                                to ensure fair influence in the network, preventing any single user from dominating the system.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Recursive Trust:</strong> A user's trust score depends not just on how much trust they receive, 
                                but also on the trustworthiness of those who trust them.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Personalized Trust:</strong> You decide who to trust based on your own assessment, creating a 
                                personalized trust network.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Sybil Resistance:</strong> The system is designed to resist manipulation through fake accounts.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h3>How to Participate</h3>
                        <p>Assigning trust is as simple as tweeting with the right format:</p>
                        
                        <div class="example-box p-3 mb-4 border rounded">
                            <p><strong>Assigning Trust/Distrust (0-100 Scale, 50 is Neutral):</strong></p>
                            <p class="text-primary"><code>#ufotrust @username 80</code> (assigns 80 points - strong trust)</p>
                            <p class="text-primary"><code>#ufotrust @username 50</code> (assigns 50 points - neutral)</p>
                            <p class="text-primary"><code>#ufotrust @username 20</code> (assigns 20 points - strong distrust)</p>
                        </div>
                        
                        <div class="alert alert-info">
                            <strong>Remember:</strong> Ratings range from 0 (complete distrust) to 100 (complete trust), with 50 as neutral. Your ratings are automatically normalized for influence.
                        </div>
                        
                        <h3>Trust Score Calculation</h3>
                        <p>
                            Trust scores are calculated using an eigenvector-based approach similar to PageRank:
                        </p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>We create a trust matrix where each cell represents how much trust user A gives to user B.</li>
                            <li>Each user's trust assignments are normalized using L2 normalization (vector length = 1) to ensure fair influence in the network.</li>
                            <li>Positive and negative trust are processed separately, with negative trust acting as a penalty.</li>
                            <li>We calculate PageRank scores based on positive trust relationships.</li>
                            <li>We apply penalties based on weighted distrust using a tanh function that creates diminishing returns for excessive distrust.</li>
                            <li>The scores converge to stable values that represent each user's global trust score.</li>
                        </ol>
                        
                        <h3>Communities</h3>
                        <p>
                            The trust network naturally forms communities of users who trust each other more than they trust 
                            outsiders. These communities often align with shared interests or perspectives.
                        </p>
                        
                        <h3>Viewing Scores by Community</h3>
                        <p>
                            You can view trust scores from different perspectives:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Global Scores:</strong> The default view, showing overall trust scores in the entire network.</li>
                            <li><strong>Community-Specific Scores:</strong> Use the dropdown menu available on the 'Rankings' page and the 'Network' visualization page to select a community. 
                                The scores (and node sizes in the network) will then reflect trust relationships *within* that selected community only. This helps you see who is influential or trusted locally within a specific group.
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                                        The eigenvector-based calculation means that trust from low-trusted accounts has minimal impact. 
                                        New accounts must first earn trust from established users before they can significantly influence the network.
                                        Additionally, L2 normalization ensures that no single user can have an outsized influence on the system.
