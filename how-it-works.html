                        <h3>Core Concept</h3>
                        <p>
                            The Twitter Trust System is an experimental reputation system based on the concept of 
                            eigenvector-based trust metrics, similar to Google's PageRank algorithm but with human-directed 
                            trust assignments.
                        </p>
                        
                        <h3>Key Features</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Simple Rating System:</strong> Rate any Twitter user from 0 (complete distrust) 
                                to 100 (complete trust), with 50 being neutral.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Normalized Trust Assignments:</strong> Your ratings are automatically normalized using L2 normalization 
                                to ensure fair influence in the network, preventing any single user from dominating the system.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Recursive Trust:</strong> A user's trust score depends not just on how much trust they receive, 
                                but also on the trustworthiness of those who trust them.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Personalized Trust:</strong> You decide who to trust based on your own assessment, creating a 
                                personalized trust network.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Sybil Resistance:</strong> The system is designed to resist manipulation through fake accounts.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h3>How to Participate</h3>
                        <p>Assigning trust is as simple as tweeting with the right format:</p>
                        
                        <div class="example-box p-3 mb-4 border rounded">
                            <p><strong>Assigning Trust/Distrust (0-100 Scale, 50 is Neutral):</strong></p>
                            <p>Standard command:</p>
                            <p class="text-primary"><code>#ufotrust @username 80</code> (assigns 80 points - strong trust)</p>
                            <p>If replying to a user, you can omit their @username in the command:</p>
                            <p class="text-primary"><code>@someuser Great point! #ufotrust 75</code> (assigns 75 points to @someuser)</p>
                            <p class="text-primary"><code>#ufotrust 50</code> (in a reply, assigns 50 points - neutral - to the user being replied to)</p>
                            <p class="text-primary"><code>#ufotrust 20</code> (in a reply, assigns 20 points - strong distrust - to the user being replied to)</p>
                        </div>
                        
                        <div class="alert alert-info">
                            <strong>Remember:</strong> Ratings range from 0 (complete distrust) to 100 (complete trust), with 50 as neutral. Your ratings are automatically normalized for influence.
                        </div>
                        
                        <h3>Trust Score Calculation</h3>
                        <p>
                            Trust scores are calculated using an eigenvector-based approach similar to PageRank:
                        </p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>We create a trust matrix where each cell represents how much trust user A gives to user B.</li>
                            <li>Each user's trust assignments are normalized using L2 normalization (vector length = 1) to ensure fair influence in the network.</li>
                            <li>Positive and negative trust are processed separately, with negative trust acting as a penalty.</li>
                            <li>We calculate PageRank scores based on positive trust relationships.</li>
                            <li>We apply penalties based on weighted distrust using a tanh function that creates diminishing returns for excessive distrust.</li>
                            <li>The scores converge to stable values that represent each user's global trust score.</li>
                        </ol>
                        
                        <h3>Communities</h3>
                        <p>
                            The trust network naturally forms communities of users who trust each other more than they trust 
                            outsiders. These communities often align with shared interests or perspectives.
                        </p>
                        
                        <div class="alert alert-info mb-3">
                            <h5>Enhanced Community Detection</h5>
                            <p>The UFO Trust System uses an advanced community detection method that:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Identifies Natural Clusters:</strong> Automatically detects communities based on who trusts whom, without requiring a predefined number of communities.</li>
                                <li><strong>Handles Isolated Users:</strong> Intelligently assigns users with few or no positive connections to appropriate communities based on a combination of:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Direct trust relationships (who trusts them and who they trust)</li>
                                        <li>Distrust patterns (applying the "enemy of my enemy" principle from structural balance theory)</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                                <li><strong>Recognizes Community Structure:</strong> Creates more coherent communities that reflect the natural divisions in the UFO/UAP discussion space.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </div>
                        
                        <h3>Viewing Scores by Community</h3>
                        <p>
                            You can view trust scores from different perspectives:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Global Scores:</strong> The default view, showing overall trust scores in the entire network.</li>
                            <li><strong>Community-Specific Scores:</strong> Use the dropdown menu available on the 'Rankings' page and the 'Network' visualization page to select a community. 
                                The scores (and node sizes in the network) will then reflect trust relationships *within* that selected community only. This helps you see who is influential or trusted locally within a specific group.
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                                        Additionally, L2 normalization ensures that no single user can have an outsized influence on the system.
